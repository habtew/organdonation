      story: "Three years ago, I was diagnosed with end-stage liver disease. The doctors told me I had months to live without a transplant. Just when hope seemed lost, I received the call that would change everything. Someone I never met made the selfless decision to donate their organs, and because of that, I'm alive today. I've been able to see my daughter graduate and hold my first grandchild. Every day is a gift, and I'm forever grateful to my donor for their ultimate act of kindness.",

      story: "When I found out my colleague needed a kidney, I didn't hesitate to get tested. We weren't particularly close, but I couldn't ignore someone in need when I had the power to help. The testing showed I was a match, and six months later, we both underwent surgery. Today, Mark is thriving with my kidney, and I'm back to my normal life. People call me a hero, but I just did what any decent person would do. The joy of seeing Mark healthy again is all the reward I need.",

      story: "Losing our son Matthew in a car accident was the worst day of our lives. But in our darkest moment, we found comfort in honoring his wish to be an organ donor. Matthew's heart, liver, kidneys, and corneas went to five different people. His death was not in vainâ€”he lives on in others. We've since met the woman who received his heart, and hearing Matthew's heartbeat in her chest was an indescribable feeling. Our son continues to save lives even after his is gone.",

      story: "As a former marathon runner, being diagnosed with congestive heart failure at 32 was devastating. For two years, I could barely walk up a flight of stairs. Then I received the precious gift of a new heart. Within a year of my transplant, I competed in the Transplant Games. Now, five years later, I've completed three half-marathons. With every step I take, I think of my donor and their family. I run not just for myself, but for them and to inspire others on the waiting list to keep fighting.",

      story: "After a workplace accident left me with severely damaged corneas, I lived in a blurry world for nearly three years. Simple tasks became monumental challenges. Thanks to a cornea donor, I underwent a successful transplant last year. The first time I clearly saw my husband's face again, I broke down crying. Now I can read to my children, drive, and enjoy the vibrant colors of the world. I write to my donor's family every year to thank them for giving me back the gift of sight.",
