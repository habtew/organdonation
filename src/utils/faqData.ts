      question: "Who can be an organ donor?",
      answer: "Anyone, regardless of age or medical history, can sign up to be a donor. Medical professionals evaluate organ and tissue viability at the time of death. Even people with chronic conditions such as diabetes or hepatitis can donate. The transplant team will determine which organs and tissues can be used at the time of donation."
    },
    {
      question: "Does my religion support organ donation?",
      answer: "Most major religions in the United States support organ donation and consider it a final act of love and generosity toward others. If you're unsure about your religion's stance on donation, we encourage you to speak with your religious leader."
    },
    {
      question: "Will doctors try less hard to save my life if they know I'm a donor?",
      answer: "No. Doctors and medical professionals' primary focus is always to save your life. The medical team treating you has nothing to do with transplantation. Organ donation only becomes a possibility after a person has been declared dead. The transplant team is entirely separate from the medical team working to save your life."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a cost to my family for donation?",
      answer: "No. There is no cost to donors or their families for organ or tissue donation. The organ recipient and their insurance cover all donation-related costs."
    },
    {
      question: "Will donation affect funeral arrangements?",
      answer: "No. Organ and tissue donation doesn't interfere with having an open-casket funeral. The donor's body is treated with care and respect throughout the donation process, and funeral arrangements can proceed as planned."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I register to become a donor?",
      answer: "You can register through your state's donor registry (often when getting or renewing your driver's license), or through our sign-up form on this website. It's also important to discuss your decision with your family members so they're aware of your wishes."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I specify which organs I want to donate?",
      answer: "Yes. During the registration process, you can specify which organs and tissues you wish to donate. You can choose to donate all organs and tissues or select specific ones."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I change my mind about being a donor?",
      answer: "Yes. You can change or revoke your donor status at any time by updating your state's donor registry or your driver's license status."
